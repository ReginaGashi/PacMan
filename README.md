# PacMan
## PacMan Exercise


**Description:** This displays an image of PacMan moving from left to right across the screen and then reversing back.

<img src= "PacMan1.png" width = '300'/>

**How to Run:**
You can clone this repository to your own machine.  Load your browser page using the file called "Index.html" to generate the PacMan images on your own screen.

**Roadmap of Future Improvements:**
 In the near future I plan to create a few more PacMan images and have them move around the screen simultaneously.
