# PacMan
## PacMan Exercise


Description: This displays an image of PacMan moving from left to right across the screen and then reversing back.

<img src= "PacMan1.png" width = '300'/>

How to Run:
You can clone this repository to your own machine.  Load your browser page using the file called "Index.html" to generate the PacMan images on your own screen.

Roadmap of Future Improvements:
 In the near future I plan to create a few more PacMan images and have them move around the screen simultaneously.
